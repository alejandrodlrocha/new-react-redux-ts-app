//All of the counter slice actions are imported and exported from the same file. 
// This is a common pattern in Redux Toolkit to keep the code organized and maintainable. 
// The actions are defined in the slice and can be dispatched from any component that connects to the Redux store. 
// The `increment`, `decrement`, and `incrementByAmount` actions are used to modify the state of the counter,
//  which is managed by the `counterSlice`.
import { createAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import * as actionTypes from './types';

import {
  setUser,
  setLoading
} from './reducers';
import { act } from 'react';

// Here is a space for create actions to call sagas.
const fetchUser = createAction<number>(actionTypes.FETCH_USER_REQUEST);

export {
  setLoading,
  setUser,
  fetchUser
};
// The above code imports the action creators from the counter slice and re-exports them.
